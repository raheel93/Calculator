/**
 An object that provides facilities for expecting selector invocations.
 This object is meant to be used to test communication between objects.
 
 This object is intended to be subclassed by mock objects. For example, suppose
 you have a protocol called `FooProtocol` and a mock implementation called
 `MockFoo`. You could make `MockFoo` extend this class, and then your tests that
 use `MockFoo` could use the methods on this class to expect certain selectors on
 `MockFoo` to be invoked.
 
 `MockFoo` would use the subclassing methods to indicate when a given selector
 has been invoked, which would in turn fulfill any expectations matching that
 selector.
